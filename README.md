# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI Linear Gauge Control

The [.NET MAUI Linear Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-linear-gauge?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-Linear-gauge-github-samples) is a multipurpose data visualization control that displays numerical values on a linear scale either horizontally or vertically. A quick start of the .NET MAUI project that shows how to create and configure the Linear Gauge control of Syncfusion. This project also includes a code snippet to set a specific axis pointer value and customize the axis line height and width as well as how to add multiple axis ranges.

## Features and Benefits

### Orientation
The appearance of the [.NET MAUI Linear Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-linear-gauge) can be set to both vertical and horizontal orientations. You can choose horizontal gauge or vertical gauge depending on your requirements.

### Axis line
The axis is a scale where a set of values can be plotted. An axis line can be customized by changing its thickness, color, corner radius, and edge styles.

### Ticks and labels
The axis elements, such as labels, major ticks, and minor ticks, can be customized to different styles. You can also add prefix or suffix text to a axis label.

### Linear range
A range is a visual element that helps you quickly visualize where a data range falls on the axis track. You can add a child content inside the linear range. Multiple ranges with different styles can be added to a linear gauge. You can also customize the position of the range.
